# Neo4j GraphQL Tutorial
This repository acts as a small Neo4j + GraphQL + Apollo Server tutorial, with all the boilerplate ready.

## Start the local environment
Nothing simpler! run 
``` 
docker-compose up
```
from the root directory, and wait about 30 seconds for the neo4j container to be ready. 
The docker is built with the `src` directory mounted, and with livereload with `nodemon`.
